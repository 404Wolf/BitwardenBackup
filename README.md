# Bitwarden Backup Human-izer
## A program to convert a bitwarden json backup into sleek html

### How to use:
1. Get the [official bitwarden desktop app](https://bitwarden.com/download/), in order to export your vault as a json file
1. Open the bitwarden desktop app, and click `file > export vault`, making sure to choose `json` as the format.
1. Once you reenter your master password, choose to download the json export in the same file directory as this project's `main.py`, and rename the export to `export.json`. You should be left with an **unencrypted** json file. When you are finished, you will want to delete this file and empty your trash.
1. Open console, and run `main.py` by entering `python main.py`, or `python3 main.py`, depending on your operating system. If you get a `ModuleNotFound` error, type `pip install <name of module that was not found>`. Depending on how many items are in your vault, this process can take a considerable amount of time (sometimes minutes).
1. Open `output.html` in a web browser such as [chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), and print out the file, or save it as a pdf by clicking the `save as pdf` option under `printers`.
1. Delete the `qrCodes` folder, `output.html` file, and `export.json` file when you are done, and **empty your trash**! If you use a utility such as google drive backup and sync, do not put these files in a folder that syncs. These files contain unencrypted sensitive data.

### Use cases:
- Printing out the backup 
- Storing as a backup on a hard drive, in case bitwarden ever goes away in the future
- Having access to your vault without needing a device

### Future plans:
- Folder support (colour coding, or small tab on right side to indicate folder name)
- Credit card image generation (for credit card type items, generate a picture of a credit card with the user's info on it)
- Automatic html to pdf conversion
- Mark/save where the user has printed up to, so they can only print new content
- Decrypt encrypted bitwarden json backups
- Fix inaccurate/broken progress bar
